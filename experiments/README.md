# Experiments

Keep reproducible experiment entry points here. Each experiment should declare
its configuration, seed where applicable, expected outputs, and artifact path.
Do not commit generated outputs.

`endogenous_bootstrap.py` uses one single-slot rewrite attempt as one step. Its
random initialization is the only exogenous target-selection phase; all later
rewrites use relation-derived candidates. During a long run it writes step
progress and the most recent stage statistics to standard error once per minute,
without an additional scan. Generated CSV, JSON, snapshot, and Markdown files
belong under the ignored `artifacts/` tree.

Heavy snapshots additionally measure candidate-set sizes and closed strongly
connected components of the candidate graph. These measurements are derived
entirely from the heavy snapshot and do not alter or instrument each rewrite.
